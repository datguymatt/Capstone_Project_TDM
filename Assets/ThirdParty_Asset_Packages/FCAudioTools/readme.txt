-----------
Wave Editor
-----------
Wave Editor provides the raw level editing of audio files to you.
You can edit such as cut/copy/paste.

If from your sound assets want to cut the silence part, you can use this.
If the volume of the sound assets which you want to use does not match, you can use this.
If you want to embed a loop point in your assets, you can use this.

To try it out.
1) Show WaveEditor tab. (Choose menu Window -> FCAudioTools -> Wave Editor)
2) Drop file to edit from project tab to the Wave Editor window.
3) Use the WaveEditor to the editing of the waveform.
4) Choose to save (overwrite or new file).


--------------
Level Adjuster
--------------
Are you troubled by the sound effects and music volume is incorrect?
Sound experts in your team, might have different work.
Do not worry even in such a case. To drop the file you want to edit to Level Adjuster window.
And, while listening to each sound, moving the volume bar.
The sound is immediately able to preview.
I believe that it is difficult to adjust to listening?
The tool adds RMS-based analysis capabilities.

To try it out.
1) Show WaveEditor tab. (Choose menu Window -> FCAudioTools -> Level Adjuster)
2) Drop files to adjust from project tab to the Level Adjuster window.
3) Change sound level by the slider or using analyze.
4) Choose to save (all overwrite).

I have plans to offer you the other tools in the future.
All of these will be included to the package of FC Audio Tools.
It will work on Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux.

However, the FC Audio Tools is not a tool for the only sound professionals.
Developer beginners and hobbyist is, is to provide a package that can be safely processing the audio.
So, if there is that you are in trouble in the sound, please tell me whether it to me.
